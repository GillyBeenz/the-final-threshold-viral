## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### "Username is taken"

- Or: DystopianReads, ThrillerReads, EthicalThrillers

### "Phone verification required"
- Use your real phone number (it's safe)
- You can use same number for multiple accounts
- Or use Google Voice (free virtual number)

### "Email already in use"
- Make sure you're using the +alias trick
- Example: `yourname+twitter@gmail.com`
- Each +alias is treated as unique by platforms

### "Account suspended immediately"
- Don't use VPN during signup
- Don't create multiple accounts from same IP in same hour
- Wait 24 hours between account creations
- Make sure to verify email
